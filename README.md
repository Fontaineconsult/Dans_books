Udacity CRUD Project

This is the 4th project for the Udacity FSND.

This is a flask based website that provides CRUD functionality for a book holding database. The source data was taken from a real
database used at a university. 

It is written for python 2.

In order to run, make sure the following Python modules are installed.

1. Flask
2. Flask-paginate (https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-paginate/)


The Flask page contoller is contained in the file view_controler.py. In order to run the webpage copy the git repo into a 
folder and run view_contoler.py
